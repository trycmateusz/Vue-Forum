# Vueschool Vue Forum

Project from Vueschool's Masterclass. My part was redoing all the component and store logic.<br>
The course was using Vue 3 with Options API and VueX, but I managed to convert all the code to Pinia and Composition API.<br>
This was the biggest turning point in my Vue journey.
